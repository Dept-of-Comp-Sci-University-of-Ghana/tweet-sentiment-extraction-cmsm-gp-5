Data Preprocessing: The code applies text cleaning techniques to remove URLs and special characters from the 'text' column of the DataFrame. It also converts the text to lowercase to ensure consistent analysis.

Word Cloud Generation: The code generates a word cloud for all the words in the 'text' column. The word cloud effectively visualizes the most frequent words in the dataset. The word cloud is appropriately sized, and the choice of a black background adds emphasis to the words.

Sentiment Analysis and Phrase Extraction: The code performs sentiment analysis using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the NLTK library. It then extracts selected phrases based on the sentiment score of consecutive word pairs. The selected phrases are stored in a new column named 'new' in the DataFrame.

Word Cloud for Selected Phrases: The code generates another word cloud for the selected phrases from the 'new' column. The word cloud effectively visualizes the most frequent phrases related to the specified sentiment. Again, the word cloud is well-sized and has a black background for emphasis.
